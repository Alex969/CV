I'm a former fine arts and digital arts student making my way in the tech industry as a junior dev. I'm very interested in graphics and generating 3D models and hope to be able to implement that in the context of gaming and machine learning in the future ! As of now my interest lies mostly in Front-End, although I have experience on a Full-Stack scope, using techs such as React, TypeScript and GraphQL.

## Work Experience
  
#### Makers Academy - Bootcamp London, September 2021 - December 2021 
```  
A full-stack coding bootcamp that runs for three months and teaches you the most relevant
tech stacks, as well as the soft/industry skills needed to kickstart your career in tech !
 
In terms of tech skills, the bootcamp has made me proficient in :
  
1.JavaScript (React, Jest and Node.js/npm packages)
2.Ruby (Ruby on Rails, RSPEC, capybara, sinatra)
3.RESTful APIs handling (creating, fetching, mocking them for tests)
4.MVC architectures
5.PostgreSQL (creating databases/tables and linking them to the front-end) HTML/CSS
6.Bootstrap/Material UI
7.Github version control
  
The pinned projects acebook-react and bnb-makers on my github profile do a good job at highlighting those skills. 
My involvement in those two projects have been on a full-stack scope, though my work on acebook-react has been more 
focused on the front-end (using React hooks and fetching the back-end API to display data and POST data such as 
messages and sign up information) and styling !
  
I've had the opportunity to work on many projects (in groups of 5+, in pairs of 2 or solo) following AGILE methodologies 
such as TDD , pair programming, delivering an MVP and SCRUM. We had a strong focus on emotional intelligence, empathy 
and listening to your peers to make a team work better.

##### Nanny & Retail Assistant 
  
  ````
  Even though my previous work experiences might not be the most relevant to the positions I'm applying to 
  as of today, they have been significant markers of who I am, the environment I grew up in and what I needed to 
  do to sustain myself through my studies.
I have been a retail assistant through 2020 and most recently a full-time nanny for a year, before starting 
  the bootcamp. I can say that both those experiences made me very comfortable engaging with anyone and being a 
  reliable person. I worked under so much pressure, with so much responsibilities and expectations (including health ones 
  when it comes to nannying) that I'm now very quick on my feet and adaptable !
